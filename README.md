# Solobuy

Solobuy is an online auction that sells one item at a time. Rare, unique, or one-of-a-kind item can be submitted to a "queue," where it has the opportunity to be voted on by the community for auction.  

## Getting Started

Just download the files. If you have suggestion on how to make this easier lmk!

### Prerequisites

At the moment, you'll need a way to compile sass. You may also need Webpack. IDK. I'm just a front-end guy. I'll update this section as needed.

## Built With

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - The web framework used
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - Assets bundler
